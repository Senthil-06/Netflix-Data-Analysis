🎬 ##Netflix Data Analysis

This is one of my early Data Science projects where I explored the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to understand what kind of content Netflix has, how it has grown over the years, and what trends can be observed.
The main goal of this project was to practice real-world data analysis using Python, work with a large dataset, create visualizations, and derive meaningful insights instead of just writing code.

📌 ##What this project does :

->Compared Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix

->Checked how much Netflix has grown over the years

->Found which countries contribute the most content

->Explored the most common genres

->Analyzed the ratings to see what type of audience Netflix mainly targets

🗂️ ##About the Dataset
I used the “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” dataset from Kaggle.
It contains information like title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genre.

🛠️ ##Tools I Used
->Python
->Pandas
->NumPy
->Matplotlib
->Seaborn

📊 ##What I Did (Step by Step)

->Loaded and understood the dataset
->Cleaned missing values
->Extracted additional features like year added
->Performed Exploratory Data Analysis
->Created meaningful graphs
->Wrote insights based on the results

📈 ##Key Insights I Found

->Netflix has more Movies than TV Shows
->Content increased massively after 2015
->USA and India are among the top content contributors
->Drama, International Movies, and Documentaries are highly common
->Most shows are rated TV-MA or TV-14, meaning Netflix mainly targets teens and adults
->Netflix has clearly shifted from being US-centric to becoming a truly global streaming platform
